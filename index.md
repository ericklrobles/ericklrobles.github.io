### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-sam-erick-and-brandon)
  
   Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first few programs where I applied what I learned. This included concepts of control flow statements and functions. This was a lab that led me to create something practical, such as the program we made of converting units and making a guessing game.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-erick-kyle)
  
   Lab 6, part 2, was another one of my favorite labs because we got to program blackjack, which was initially challenging but was a learning experience. This introduced me to using built-in functions like STOI and STOD. This helped me with later labs and was one of the many tools I added to my toolbelt for C++.


* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-erick-and-eileen)
  
   Lab 10, part 2, was also one of my favorite labs because we used the given 2D vector of counties and populations. We organized it through our defined functions, loops, and conditions. This goes to answer the given specific county through the user's input, which returns the population grabbed within the 2D vector back to the user.
